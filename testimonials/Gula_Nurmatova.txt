I met Joseph, Michael and Chris from Terminal Labs while working on a complex machine learning platform at Raytheon Technologies. They quickly have become invaluable team members for their outstanding collaboration, technical acumen and sheer desire to help. Joseph has made a number of major improvements to our distributed multi-tier platform that has cut down on maintenance work drastically and improved the functionality and reliability of the application. Michael has helped greatly with spinning up a data platform. Chris fixed and put in series of enhancements to several APIs and machine learning libraries. While being amazing performers, Joseph, Chris and Michael were also a pleasure to work with.
