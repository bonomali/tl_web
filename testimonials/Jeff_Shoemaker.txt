It took us a long time to find the right people to own architect duties for a demanding commercial real estate application already in development. It was critical to assemble a team that could come in "cold," absorb context and provide value quickly. After a long search we found Terminal Labs and brought on Mike and Chris. Within a few hours we knew weâ€™d made the right decision. They soon emerged as leaders and mentors of the overall engineering team. Mike and Chris brought a true agile approach to a host of difficult problems with grace and tact. I look forward to working with them again and would not hesitate to recommend them (unless of course I need them!).
