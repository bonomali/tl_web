The Terminal Labs team were great partners for Cox Media Group. Over the course of 2 years Joe, Chris, and Michael helped us with the ground-up development of websites for our flagship newspaper brands Austin American Statesman, Atlanta Journal Constitution, Dayton Daily News, and the Palm Beach Post. The Terminal Labs team offer a can-do attitude, strong work ethic, great communication, and adaptability to any of the new challenges we proposed. As we completed our major deliverables Joe, Chris and Michael helped us optimize our custom CMS platform and front-end templates to improve the customer experience through faster page load times. When we have other projects that would be a fit for the Terminal Labs Team, they will be top of mind for us.

--Jason Munson, Sr. Director of Technology at Cox Media Group
